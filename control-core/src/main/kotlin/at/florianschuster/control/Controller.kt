/**
 * A [Controller] is an ui-independent class that controls the state of a view. The role of a
 * [Controller] is to separate business-logic from view-logic. A [Controller] has no dependency
 * to the view, so it can easily be unit tested.
 *
 *
 * <pre>
 *                  [Action] via [dispatch]
 *          +-----------------------------------+
 *          |                                   |

 *     |   View   |                    |   Controller   |
 *     |    ^     |                    |                |

 *          +-----------------------------------+
 *                  [State] via [state]
 * </pre>
 *
 * The [Controller] creates an uni-directional stream of data as shown in the diagram above, by
 * handling incoming [Action]'s via [Controller.dispatch] and creating new [State]'s that
 * can be collected via [Controller.state].
 *
 * Basic Principle: 1 [Action] -> [0..n] [Mutation] -> each 1 new [State]
 *
 * For implementation details look into:
 * 1. [Mutator]: [Action] -> [Mutation]
 * 2. [Reducer]: [Mutation] -> [State]
 * 3. [Transformer]
 * 4. [ControllerImplementation]
 *
 * To create a [Controller] use [CoroutineScope.createController].
